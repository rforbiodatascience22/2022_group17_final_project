## Content

* Introduction to Dataset

Patient medical data (subject_id, age, acuity, â€¦)
Proteomics (Olink Assay)

* Data Cleaning

* Study Population (Bar plot & Violin plot)

* Modeling (PCA, Volcano plot & Heatmap)



## Introduction

* Longitudinal study with 306 COVID-19 patients and 78 symptomatic controls
* Identifying immune and non-immune proteins linked to COVID - 19

## Introdiction / Study Aim / Methods / Results

* Covid-19 : > 1 million cases
* Immune dysfunction (hyper- & hypo- immune response)
* Limited of sample size or narrow set of immune mediators
* Plasma proteomics 

* To gain insights into underlying disease mechanisms, researchers map proteomics (n=1,472) to specific cell types in the context of relevant clinical phenotypes.

* Plasma collection and processing (in patients (n=306) vs controls = 78)
* Olink plasma proteomic assays
* Quality control (Olink)
