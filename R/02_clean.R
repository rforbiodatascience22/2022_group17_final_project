# NPX, Normalized Protein eXpression, is Olinkâ€™s arbitrary unit which is in Log2 
# scale. It is calculated from Ct values and data pre-processing (normalization) 
# is performed to minimize both intra- and inter-assay variation. NPX data allows 
# users to identify changes for individual protein levels across their sample set, 
# and then use this data to establish protein signatures.
